/*Revenue can be calculated as the selling price of the product times the quantity sold, 
i.e. revenue = price Ã— quantity. Write a program that asks the user to enter product price 
and quantity and then calculate the revenue. If the revenue is more than 5000 a discount is 10% offered.
 Program should display the discount and net revenue. */
